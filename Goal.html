        <p style="line-height: 20px; font-size: 16px;font-size: 17px">
            My career goal is to become a computer engineer. 
            I want to experience, and keep growing through education. 
            I put my focus on creating new technologies, contribute to the tech community, and make a positive impact in my field. 
            I wanna to pulish a app that is related to wifi because the wifi sometimes don't work and i wanna build app that could work ten times faster without any trouble.
        </p>
        <h2 style="font-weight:bolder;color:brown;font: size 30px;">College Plans</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 17px">
            I plan to attend San Jose State University (SJSU), a four-year institution. 
            The major I want to achieve in the future is computer engineering because it reminds me of my mom, who is taking and will soon graduate from SJSU. 
            However, SJSU is one of the many colleges I have chosen. I am also interested in other colleges, such as the University of California, Santa Cruz,
            California State University Long Beach, and Boston University. If I didn't get into a university, I go to West Valley Fair College or San Jose City College 
            and later switch to a university.
